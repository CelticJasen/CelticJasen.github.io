TicTacToe created using React. This project utilizes immutability to implement an undo/redo "time travel" function.

Machine Learning:
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/CelticJasen/myMLApp">Project</a>
<br>
This is an app I made that will predict whether comments made by users are toxic or not.
<br>

<br>
Examples include PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, MySQL. I currently develop software on the back end of a LAMP server at eMoviePoster.com. On top of that, I also do some contract work in web development with WordPress and software development in .NET and I run a small mobile IT support operation of my own for the West Plains area involving residential and commercial customers.
<br>

Java:

C# scripts created for game development with Unity3D. Most notable work is with A* Pathfinding algorithm, AI decision trees, and Inverse Kinematics.
<br>
<br>
The following links will take you to some videos of game projects in progress that I created for clients in the past. Please be mindful of your volume as some of these are using temporary sound assets that are known to be hard on the ears.
<br>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ipw4t_Pwjrc">Block Slam</a></li> A current project's main menu that uses mathematical functions to transform image shape randomly over time in a fluid manner.
