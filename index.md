### Projects

Email Summary Text Alert:
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/CelticJasen/EmailTextAlert">Project</a>
<br>
This is an app I made that will retrieve specific emails and parse through them to create a summary of the email using regular expressions and PHP string functions. Once finished, it will send that summary to each member via text message. All member information is stored in a database. Text massaging is made possible by use of Vonage's text relay API.
<br>

Machine Learning:
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/CelticJasen/myMLApp">Project</a>
<br>
This is an app I made that will predict whether comments made by users are toxic or not.
<br>

Expense Tracker:
<br>

<br>
Examples include PHP, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, Python, MySQL. I currently develop software on the back end of a LAMP server at eMoviePoster.com. On top of that, I also do some contract work in web development with WordPress and software development in .NET and I run a small mobile IT support operation of my own for the West Plains area involving residential and commercial customers.
<br>

C#:
<br>
<a href="https://github.com/CelticJasen/gamescripts">Work Examples</a>
<br>
C# scripts created for game development with Unity3D. Most notable work is with A* Pathfinding algorithm, AI decision trees, and Inverse Kinematics.

The following links will take you to some videos of game projects in progress that I created for clients in the past. Please be mindful of your volume as some of these are using temporary sound assets that are known to be hard on the ears.
